# Introduction

The Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) measures [essential ocean variables](https://goosocean.org/what-we-do/framework/essential-ocean-variables/) around the coast of Nova Scotia through their Coastal Monitoring Program. Through this Program, the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture (NSDFA) and CMAR have deployed Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) at a variety of locations to measure sea state (waves) and currents. This document presents deployment details and summary figures of sea state data collected for deployment **`r depl_id`** in `r county` County (Figure `r k` and Figure `r k+1`). The corresponding current report can be found on the CMAR website [Reports page](https://cmar.ca/reports/).

The data are available for download from the Nova Scotia [Open Data Portal](https://data.novascotia.ca/browse?q=wave&sortBy=relevance). For more information on CMAR and the sea state datasets, visit the [CMAR website](https://cmar.ca/).

This document should be considered as a guide only, as data collection is ongoing. The information may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.

## Data Collection 

CMAR collects wave data using upward facing Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) mounted on the sea floor for 1 - 3 months (Figure `r k`). An ADCP uses sound to measure current speed and direction through the water column. ADCP software uses many measurements recorded over a given time interval (averaging period) to calculate key sea state parameters, including wave height, period, and direction [@RN29853]. 

CMAR uses several ADCP instrument models, including the Sentinel V20, Sentinel V50, Sentinel V100, and Workhorse Sentinel 600kHz. The data is processed using Velocity and WavesMon4 Software by Teledyne RD Instruments [@RN29849]. The data are compiled, formatted, and visualized for publication with  CMAR's [`waves`](https://github.com/dempsey-CMAR/waves) R package [@RN29876]. 

For an overview of "Waves Basics" and the wave calculations made by the Velocity and WavesMon software, refer to @RN29850. For more details on the instruments and software, refer to @RN29853 and @RN29849. 

## Wave Parameters

Wave height is the vertical distance between the peak and trough of a wave [@RN29853]. One of the most common wave height parameters is the significant wave height (Hs), which is often defined as the average height of the largest one-third of waves in the sampling interval (H1/3) [@RN29853]. This roughly corresponds to the four times the square root of the zeroth-order moment of the wave spectrum, which is the quantity typically reported by the software [@RN29853]. Other common wave height parameters include the average height of the largest one-tenth of waves in the measurement interval (H1/10), and the height of the largest wave in the interval (Hmax) [@RN29850; @RN29913].

Wave period is the time between consecutive waves. The peak wave period (Tp) is associated with the largest spike of the power spectrum for a given time interval. T1/3, T1/10, and Tmax are the periods related to the corresponding wave height parameters [@RN29849].

Wave direction indicates the direction the peak wave energy is propagating towards [@RN29853]. Direction is reported here relative to True North.

Significant wave height and maximum wave height, their corresponding periods, and wave direction are presented below. A reports summarizing the associated current speed and direction measured the ADCP at this location can be found on the CMAR website. The full wave and current datasets can be downloaded from the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal.

## Quality Control

The ADCP software automatically performs some Quality Control checks during data processing [@RN29850; @RN29849]. For example, observations that are more than 5 standard deviations from the mean are discarded, and three methods for calculating wave height and period are compared.

**re-write this after reviewing all data**
Additional Quality Control was applied by CMAR during data compilation and formatting for publication using the [`waves`](https://github.com/dempsey-CMAR/waves) R package [@RN29876]. A variation of the "Gross Range" test was applied to the wave period and height parameters. Wave period variables with values ≤ 0 s were flagged as "Fail". When the recorded wave period was ≤ 0 s, the corresponding wave height was almost always 0 m, and the converse was also true (when wave height is 0 m, the period was ≤ 0 s). Wave height parameters were therefore flagged as "Fail" if the wave height was 0 m *and* the period was ≤ 0 s. All other observations were flagged as "Pass". Observations that were flagged "Fail" were not included in the figures below.
